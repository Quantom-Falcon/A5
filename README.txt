ResumeRev.AI – Smart Resume Tailoring Tool

This project is a working deployment of a web-based tool built as part of CS5800 (Advanced Software Engineering). 
The website is designed to help early-career professionals improve their job applications by tailoring resumes to specific job descriptions.

This version includes:
- A simple frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
- A backend server built with Node.js and Express
- A working API route used to test communication between frontend and backend

The frontend is served statically, and the backend exposes a basic route (`/api/hello`) to demonstrate integration. 
Both are deployed together on a single service using Render.

This is the current working version of the app deployed as part of Assignment 5 (Deployment). 
It’s set up to be publicly accessible, with build and run commands configured correctly, and all traffic served through a single endpoint.
